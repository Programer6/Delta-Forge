## Project Goals
The vision for the Delta-Forge was to create a delta printer that excels in several key areas:
- Rigid all-metal frame and a linear rail motion system to achieve high-speed & keeping high quality prints.
- A small form factor that doesn't sacrifice build volume unnecessarily. Ideal for a desk or a small workshop.
- Draw inspiration from sleek sci-fi designs, moving away from a purely utilitarian look. I want to make it something I proud to display!
- Use commonly available parts and components 

## Why I designed this 3D printer:
Well in simple words I am addicted to 3D printers design & since I don't own oen I want to get my hands on every type of 3D printer that is out there! 

##  Key Features!!
- Fully aluminum extrusion!
- MGN9C linear rail motion system for precision  
- Compact 120mm heated 
- BTT Manta E3EZ + CB1

## End Cost Estimate

- $360 (actual predicted to be 400+ but lower due to AliExpress about 350$+ discount coupon) & also not that some parts, such as screw, are ordered in bulk as not available in single quantities!
