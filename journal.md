# 3D Printer Design: CAD & PCB Documentation

**Project Status:** Awaiting funding 

**CAD:** https://a360.co/3TjGkbB

**Time**  60+ HOURS

**Respository link:**  https://github.com/Programer6/Delta-Forge/


## Frame Build (2 Hours):

I kicked things off with core structure of the printer. Since it's a delta, getting the geometry right from the start was super important.
First, I designed the main triangular frame using 2020 aluminum extrusions. This forms the three vertical towers and the triangular base and top sections & made sure all of the extrsuon where in the correct 60-degree angles.


- Assembled triangle frame using 2020

## Bottom Build Plate (3h):

At the same time, I designed the bottom build plate. I went with a hexagonal shape which matched delta's geometry & was inspired by the Delta Flyer keep the footprint small and stable. You can see the CAD screenshot where I sketched out the 120mm circular build area to make sure the hotend would have full access and everything would be centered correctly.

### Assembled together:

## Conner Support 3 extrusions Holder(7-8+h):

Atempt one one making this completely failed as you can see in the picture as this one part need ot connect to two of the bottom extrusions + the same time provide support to the top extrusion! + have the write spacing in between for the allowing the belt controled by the nema 17 motors below!! so measurement not only needed to be precise considering this is a important part! WHICH I COMPLELY FAILED DOING IN THE FIRST ATTEMPT! :(

### Atempt 1( almost 2 hours wasted):

### Atempt 2 
Measurment gome crazy aas you can see while juggling multiple thing but worth it:

## How it looks after extruded:

### Part 1:
- This was the first verison of the extrusion holder designed kept for the top part of the 3D pritner

### Part 1: 
- This was the second verison of the extrusion holder basically the same but the difference being that it allow the nema 17 extrusion to be srewed in the bottom

## Assembling (3 hours)
- Adding the extrusion to its correct places!!
- Bottom & top extrusion holder images:

## Grill design (2 hours):

Since I got one of the most important and time consuming part of the 3d Printer done I moved on to the making of a grill design to put at the buttom part of my 3D printer by screwing it together to the extrusions this is mainly for design purpose to make the 3d pritner to look overally more pretty and to hind the Nema 17 stepper motors which are hiding at the bottom of the 3d printer. Scince this requiered a bunch of boxs & stuff this was really time consuming to make!

## Spool holder (3 Hours):

Since, I don't really own a 3D printer (yet) this means that I don't have a spool holder instead of just buying one from aliexpress I thoughht that it would be a really cool ideas If I went and design one myself:

## Elctronings Holder (5 Hours):
simple box style extrusion holder for top part of the 3D pritner this took a lot of time to make for optimisng the prefect fit for example makign sure it does not touch the / overlap with other parts + also adding place to keep the electronics.

## DELTA ARMS (30 misn):
Nothing crezy download the join for the internet and made the main body of the Delta Arm in the size that I needed!

## Extrusion cover! (3.5 hours)
Cool desgn simple desingn to hide the Z axis extrusion with the 3D printed part & to hopefully use to add clear arylic (as a later upgrade) to cover it to make it look overal polished!

## PUTTING IT TOGETHER + Adding color! (5 Hours )
Pretty self explanatory

## Written work: (5 hour)

Sourcing part making the bom, find the parts of aliexpress, writing the joural & the readme which you are reading right now!!
